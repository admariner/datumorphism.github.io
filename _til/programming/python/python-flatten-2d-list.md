excerpt: Flatten 2D list using sum
---

Here is a simple way to flatten 2D list in python.

```
l = [ [1,2], [3,4], [6,7], [8, 9,10] ]
sum( l, [] )
```

This will result in 
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Why is this even working?

The function `sum(an_iterable_object)` will simply use the operator `+` for the iterable object that was passed on to it. I can take in an optional parameter, i.e.,

```
sum(a_iterable_object, where_do_the_summation_start)
``` 

The operations would be like this:

```
result = where_do_the_summation_start or 0

for i in an_iterable_object:
   result = result + i 
```

Suppose we have a nested list `[ [1,2,3], [4,5] ]`, for each iteration, sum would simply concat the sublists together.
