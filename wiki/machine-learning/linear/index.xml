Suppose a dataset have features $F_\alpha$ where $\alpha = 1, 2, \cdots, K$, with corresponding class labels $G_\alpha$. The dataset that provides $N$ datapoints with each deoted as $X_i$. The posterior of the classification is $P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i)$.
A naive idea is to classify the data into two classes $m$ and $n$ using the boundary of a linear model</description></item><item><title>Poisson Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/poisson-regression/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/poisson-regression/</guid><description>Possion regression is a generalized linear model for count data.
To model a dataset that is generated from a Poisson distribution, we only need to model the mean $\mu$ as it is the only paramters. The simplest model we can have for some given features $X$ is a linear model. However, for count data, the effects of the predictors are often multiplicative. The next simplest model we can have is</description></item></channel></rss>
