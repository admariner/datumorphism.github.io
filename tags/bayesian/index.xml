Suppose we are solving a classification problem, with features denoted as $\mathbf X$, and class results as $\mathbf Y$.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Linear Regression</title><link>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</guid><description>Linear Regression and Likelihood The linear estimator $y$ is
$$ \begin{equation} y^n = \beta^m X_m^{\phantom{m}n}. \label{eq-linear-model} \end{equation} $$
As usual, we have redefined our data to get rid of the intercept $\beta^0$.
In ordinary linear models, we find the error being the difference between the target $\hat y$ and the estimator $y$
$$ \epsilon = \hat y - y, $$
which is required to have a minimum absolute value.
In linear regressions, we use least squares to solve the problem.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Methods</title><link>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bayes' Theorem</title><link>/cards/statistics/bayes-theorem/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/statistics/bayes-theorem/</guid><description>Bayes&amp;rsquo; Theorem is stated as
