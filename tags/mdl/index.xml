Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Description Length</title><link>/cards/statistics/mdl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/statistics/mdl/</guid><description>The minimum description length, aka, MDL, is based on the idea of data compression.
MDL looks for the model that compresses the data well. To compress data, we need to find the regularity in the data.
There are many versions of MDL.
crude two-part code Fisher information approximation ( FIA FIA is a method to describe the minimum description length ( MDL MDL is a measure of how well a model compresses data ) of models, $$ \mathrm{FIA} = -\ln p(y | \hat\theta) + \frac{k}{2} \ln \frac{n}{2\pi} + \ln \int_\Theta \sqrt{ \operatorname{det}[I(\theta)] d\theta } $$ $I(\theta)$: Fisher information matrix of sample size 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
