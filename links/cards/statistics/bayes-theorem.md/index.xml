Suppose we are solving a classification problem, with features denoted as $\mathbf X$, and class results as $\mathbf Y$.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Linear Regression</title><link>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</guid><description>Linear Regression and Likelihood The linear estimator $y$ is
$$ \begin{equation} y^n = \beta^m X_m^{\phantom{m}n}. \label{eq-linear-model} \end{equation} $$
As usual, we have redefined our data to get rid of the intercept $\beta^0$.
In ordinary linear models, we find the error being the difference between the target $\hat y$ and the estimator $y$
$$ \epsilon = \hat y - y, $$
which is required to have a minimum absolute value.
In linear regressions, we use least squares to solve the problem.</description></item><item><title>Predictions Using Time Series Data</title><link>/wiki/time-series/predictions-time-series-data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/time-series/predictions-time-series-data/</guid><description>General Phenological Model for Seasonality In business, time series data $f(t)$ usually carries information about trend $g(t)$ ($g$ is used since trend is usually growth), seasonalities (periodical effects) $p(t)$, holiday effects (structural effects) $s(t)$, etc. We will decompose a time series $f(t)$ into four components
$$ \begin{equation} f(t) = g(t) + p(t) + s(t) + \epsilon(t). \end{equation} $$
To train a model for the predictions, we need to write down the exact models of these three predictable components.</description></item></channel></rss>
