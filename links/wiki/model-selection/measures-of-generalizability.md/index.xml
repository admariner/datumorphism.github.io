Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.</description></item><item><title>Goodness-of-fit</title><link>/wiki/model-selection/goodness-of-fit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/model-selection/goodness-of-fit/</guid><description>Does the data agree with the model?
Calculate the distance between data and model predictions. Apply Bayesian methods such as likelihood estimation: likelihood of observing the data if we assume the model; the results will be a set of fitting parameters. &amp;hellip; Why don&amp;rsquo;t we always use goodness-of-fit as a measure of the goodness of a model?
We may experience overfitting. The model may not be intuitive. This is why we would like to balance it with parsimony using some measures of generalizability.</description></item><item><title>Parsimony of Models</title><link>/wiki/model-selection/parsimony-of-models/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/model-selection/parsimony-of-models/</guid><description>For models with a lot of parameters, the goodness-of-fit is very likely to be very high. However, it is also likely to generalize bad. So we need measure of generalizability
Here parsinomy gives us a few advantages.
