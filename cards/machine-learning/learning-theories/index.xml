Empirical risk minimization minimizes the empirical risk to select a good model $\hat f$ out of all possible models $f$ in our hypothesis space for a dataset $\mathcal D$,
$$ \hat f = \operatorname{argmin} R(f, \mathcal D). $$ Empirical Risk Example For example, the emprical risk can be represented by the negative log likelihood.
