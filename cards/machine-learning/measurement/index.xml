Suppose we have a dataset $\{0,1\}^{10}$, which has 10 records and 2 possible classes of objects $\{0,1\}$ in each record.
The first example we investigate is a pure 0 dataset.
object 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 For such an all-0 dataset, we would like to define its impurity as 0.</description></item><item><title>Information Gain</title><link>/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</guid><description>Information gain is a frequently used metric in calculating the gain during a split in tree-based methods.
First o all, the entropy of a dataset if defined as
$$ S = - sum_i p_i \log p_i - sum_i (1-p_i)\log p_i, $$ where $p_i$ is the probability of a class.
The information gain is the difference between the entropy.
For example, in a decision tree algorithm, we would split a node. Before splitting, we assign a label $m$ to the node,</description></item></channel></rss>
