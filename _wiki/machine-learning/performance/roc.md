ROC space is the two dimensional space spanned by True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.

## AUC: Area under Curve

1. TPR = TP Rate
2. FPR = FP Rate

The ROC curve is defined by the relation $f(TPR, FPR)$. Area under the ROC curve is

$$
\int TPR(FPR) d(FPR) \sim \sum_i TPR_i *\Delta FPR.
$$

If AUC = 1, we have TP Rate = 1 for all FP Rate. This is the best performance a model could have.
