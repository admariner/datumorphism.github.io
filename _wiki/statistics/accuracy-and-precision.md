1. Accuracy: the measurement compared to the truth
2. Precision: variability of repeated measurements; the more precise, the less variations during each measurement.

| | Accurate | Inaccurate |
| Precise |  Close to true value, small variations in each measurement | Far from true value, small variations in each measurement  |
| Imprecise |  Close to true value, large variations in each measurement  |  Far from true value, large variations in each measurement  |
